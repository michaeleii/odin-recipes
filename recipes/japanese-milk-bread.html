    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A staple in Asian bakeries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (11 ounces) plus 3 tablespoons bread flour</li>
        <li>&frac12 cup (4 ounces) water</li>
        <li>&frac12 cup (4 ounces) cold whole milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1&frac12 tsp instant or rapid-rise yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1&frac12 salt</li>
        <li>3 tsp unsalted butter, softened, plus 1 tsp melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk 3 tsp flour abd water in small bowl until no lumps remain. Microwave whisking every 20 seconds, until mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Whisk milk, egg and flour paste in bow of stand mixer until smooth. Add yeast and remaining 2 cups of flour. Mix until cohesive dough starts to form and no dry flour remains (about 2 mins). Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rest for 15 mins.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and salt to dough and mix. While mixing, add softened butter, 1 tsp at a time, and mix until butter is fully incorporated about 2 mins. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic and clears sides of bowl but sticks to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand to form a smooth, round ball. Place dough seam side down in lightly greased large bowl or container, and cover tightly with plastic. Let it rise until it is doubled in size (1-1&frac12 hours)</li>
        <li>Grease loaf pan (8&frac12 by 4&frac12). Press down on dough to deflate. Turn dough out onto lightly floured counter (side of dough that was against bowl should now be facing up). Gently press and roll into a rectangle (24 by 4-in), with short side parallel to counter edge. Cut the rectangle length wise into 2 equal strips.</li>
        <li>Roll 1 strip of dough into a snug cylinder, pinch seam closed, and place seam down in prepared pan with spiral against long side of pan. Repeat with remaining strip of dough placing it adjacent to other in pan.</li>
        <li>Cover loosely with greased plastic and let it rise until loaf is level with lip of pan and dough spring back minimaly when poked gently with your knuckle (30 mins - 1 hour).</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 375 deg. Bake until it becomes a deep golden brown loaf (about 30 mins), rotate pan half way through baking. Let loaf cool in pan for 15 mins. Remove loaf from pan and transfer to wire rack. Brush top and sides with melted butter. Let cool completely about 3 hours, before serving.</li>
